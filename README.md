File synchronization plugin for Eclipse

FileSync plugin for Eclipse is a file synchronisation tool.

The main goal is to keep files outside of Eclipse projects in-sync with Eclipse project files. 
The plugin works as builder in Eclipse and will synchronize all changes on Eclipse project files to mapped external folders. 
E.g. if a file is created, changed or deleted in Eclipse, then the mapped (external) file will be created, changed or deleted too. 
Please note, that synchronization works is only in one direction - from Eclipse to the rest of the world.

You can install the plugin from [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/filesync) 
or download from [bintray](https://bintray.com/iloveeclipse/plugins/FileSync/view/files).
